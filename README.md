# rrdient directions
Get anywhere in the world

Rrdient directions is a program that gives you the most optimal directions for going wherever you're already trying to go. It is protected by **rrdient LockedLock** and requires our proprietary **rrdient LockedLock ROM** to run.

## Instructions

Run rrdient-directions-rom.py (not included) in Python 3:

`$ python3 rrdient-directions-llrom.py`

Open rrdient-directions.sb in Scratch 1.4.

Do not use while personally driving - have a passenger manage operations.

## Thin Client version

Rrdient directions can be used with any similar directions engine - simply run rrdient-directions-thinclient.sb and see the API specification in rrdient-directions-thinclient-api.txt. Note that this copy of the thin client still requires an **Rrdient LockedLock ROM**.
